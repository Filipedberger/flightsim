## Plan
We will make a flight simulator where you travel across the land and you fly the plane in third-person perspective. We will implement shaders, a large world with a skybox or skydome, collision detection with ground and obstacles in the sky and some light sources. You will need to avoid the obstacles.

If there is time also som small game logic. The game logic will be a simple time based point race where you need to follow a waypoint and reach a specific position in the air or above the ground in time. 

## Will do:
* The world will be drawn with a heightmap and textures similar to how it was done in lab 4. The skybox or skydome will be drawn from a downloaded texture similar to how it was done in lab 2.

* The plane will be a downloaded model from online sources and the plane will move slightly with movement

* The plane will be controlled with the keyboard and/or mouse and you will be able to turn, adjust speed, go up or down and look around with the mouse. 

* Simple geometry for the obstacles, like hoops to fly through and boxes to avoid or pick up.

* Collision detection with the ground and objects in the sky

* Third-person view

* Light sources on the plane and ambient light in the scene, like a sun or moon. 

## Might do:
* Dogfight with enemies controlled with an AI controller.

* Game logic where you have to fly to a certain position under a time-limit. 

* A HUD with information about the flight, speed and score.

* A minimap of the world with the position of the plane and a marker for a waypoint, target or enemies.

* Generated clouds in the sky at the same level as you fly. Particle system

* A night flight mode where the scene is dark and lights on the plane and ground provide vision and orientation.
