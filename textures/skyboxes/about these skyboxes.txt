These skyboxes have been modified to limit the problems with color "bleed"
that are a common problem with skyboxes unless you use nearest neighbor
texture access. In all these skyboxes I have, more or less, added extra
borders, mostly for the upper parts. We don't see the lower part much, if
at all, so I left them unchanged.

Legal terms for these: All are free for non-commercial use. See the "attributions" file.

The ones named "mod" are modified fairly successfully, IMHO. The ones named "try",
"http-skybox-texture" and "cloud-landscape" I had problems with, with misfits
between the parts and borders that were too hard to eliminate altogether.
